Commands:

move <square1 x> <square1 y> <to-square x> <to-square y>

Makes a normal (non-spell) move in the active game for the side to move.  This move is specified as two parameters corresponding to x and y coordinates of the square from which a piece should move, and two parameters corresponding to the x and y coordinates of the destination square.

Note that coordinates are specified with respect to the top left corner of the board; this square being 0 0, and the square corresponding to the fifth row on the first column being 4 0.

In the case of a promotion, the promotion piece (piece to be revived) must be specified.  This is specified as a character corresponding to the piece:

P - Clansman
R - Square Chieftain
D - Diagonal Chieftain
L - Leaping Chieftain
C - Champion
B - Bansidh

move-special <type> [<square1 x> <square1 y>] [<square2 x> <square2 y> <promotion-piece>] [<spell type>]

A more general version of the move command, for performing special (spell) moves.  It requires specifying the type of move:

0 - normal
1 - mist
2 - bolt kill
3 - freeze
4 - spellhammer
5 - possession
6 - shapeshift
7 - fly
8 - shield
9 - promotion
10 - bolt revive
11 - cauldron

0 specifies a normal piece movement or promotion.

Move types 1-4 and 10 are spells that consume a whole turn.  Types 1-3 require specifying the square that the spell should act on.  Type 4 (spellhammer) requires specifying the spell that should be cancelled.


to_move

Prints a number corresponding to the player with the turn.


exit

Ends the game.


random_move

Selects a move at random from all of a player's available moves, including spell moves.  Note: because moves are generated twice due to some bug, certain moves (pawn moves, it seems) have a higher chance of being chosen.

interactive <0 | 1>

Sets interactive mode.  When set to 1 (default), a text representation of the board is printed out after every move, for convenience when playing in the console.  The web frontend should set this to 0.

pass

Skips this player's turn, and moves to next player's.

move_list

Displays the moves that have been made in this game.

clear

Removes all active games held in memory.

colour <1 | 0>

Turns text colourisation on or off.  If on, the text board output is colourised to indicate who owns each piece.  On Windows, this should be set to 0, as the Windows command prompt doesn't understand the ANSI codes used for text colourisation.
